Below is a **concise, systems-level summary** of how **Teresa Torres** uses **Claude Code as a Personal Operating System (OS)**—not as a chatbot, but as a persistent, delegated cognitive worker tightly integrated with her files, tasks, and thinking workflows.
This summary is synthesized directly from the interview transcript .

---

## 1. Core Mental Model: Claude as a Long-Lived Teammate, Not a Tool

Teresa’s framing is explicit:

* Claude is treated like a **full-time employee** with:

  * Clear operating procedures
  * Memory (via files, not chat history)
  * Delegated responsibilities
* Claude is **not** a writer, decision-maker, or owner of judgment.

  * Teresa remains the principal thinker.
  * Claude augments speed, breadth, and consistency.

This mirrors how experienced operators manage human assistants: SOPs first, autonomy second.

---

## 2. The Stack: Obsidian + Claude Code = Personal OS

### Physical Setup

* **Obsidian**: canonical state of truth (Markdown files)
* **Claude Code (CLI)**: execution + reasoning layer
* **Terminal-first workflow**: zero context switching

Claude is always launched **inside a directory**, and that directory defines its “job.”

---

## 3. Directory = Role (Claude as Context-Scoped Agent)

Each folder acts like a **Claude project** with its own rules:

| Folder         | Claude’s Role                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `/tasks`       | Task manager + automation agent      |
| `/writing`     | Editor, researcher, sparring partner |
| `/research`    | Literature scanner + summarizer      |
| `/llm-context` | Memory & reference system            |

Each folder contains a `CLAUDE.md` that defines:

* What Claude is allowed to do
* How it should behave
* What files matter

No global, bloated prompts. Everything is **localized and composable**.

---

## 4. Daily Control Loop: “today” Command

Every morning Teresa runs a single command:

```
today
```

Claude then:

1. Checks Trello for new tasks
2. Scans all task Markdown files
3. Identifies:

   * Overdue tasks
   * Tasks due today
   * Ongoing projects
4. Runs Python scripts
5. Generates:

   * `Today.md`
   * `ThisWeek.md`
   * `NextWeek.md`
6. Appends:

   * Research digests (Scholar + preprints)
   * Links to active writing/research

This is a **daily recomputation of intent**, not a static to-do list.

---

## 5. Tasks as Files, Not Rows in SaaS

Key design choice:

* **Every task = a Markdown file**
* Tasks contain:

  * Frontmatter (due date, tags, status)
  * Notes
  * Checklists (when useful)

Creating tasks is O(1):

```
new task Call groomer tomorrow
new idea Marketing angle for Claude safety
```

Claude:

* Creates the file
* Places it correctly
* Updates indexes
* Optionally syncs to Trello

This eliminates UI friction and preserves **full auditability**.

---

## 6. Writing Workflow: Human-Authored, Claude-Accelerated

### What Claude Does

* Outline generation (Plan Mode)
* Counter-examples & alternative structures
* Research (academic + web)
* SEO keyword analysis
* Section-by-section critique
* Typos & clarity fixes (with approval)

### What Claude Does *Not* Do

* Write prose in Teresa’s voice
* Decide arguments
* Replace thinking

Outcome:

* 8–9k word, high-density essays
* Written in ~1.5 days
* No fluff, high rigor

Claude preserves **momentum**, not authorship.

---

## 7. Context Architecture: The 3-Layer Memory Model

### Layer 1: Global (`~/.claude.md`)

* Tiny
* Universal preferences only
* Loaded into every session

Example:

* “Always plan before acting”
* “Provide critique before edits”

### Layer 2: Project (`/writing/CLAUDE.md`, `/tasks/CLAUDE.md`)

* Role-specific behavior
* SOPs for that domain

### Layer 3: Reference Context (`/llm-context/*.md`)

* Modular, opt-in knowledge
* Business profile
* Audience definitions
* Product details
* Team info

Claude is told **where to look**, not forced to remember everything.

---

## 8. Anti-Amnesia Strategy: Process Notes

Teresa actively manages context decay:

* Before context window fills:

  * Claude updates `process-notes.md`
* Notes include:

  * Decisions made
  * Open questions
  * Current state

When context resets:

* Claude rehydrates from files
* No silent compression
* No hallucinated continuity

This is **manual memory compaction with oversight**.

---

## 9. Continuous Memory Improvement Loop

After meaningful sessions, Teresa asks:

> “What did you learn about working with me that we should save?”

Claude then:

* Proposes updates
* Suggests where they belong
* Updates indexes

Important distinction:

* **Preferences → CLAUDE.md**
* **Facts about life/business → context files**

Claude maintains its own onboarding docs.

---

## 10. Delegation Heuristic (Critical Insight)

Teresa applies a simple rule:

> “If I ever have to explain this twice, it becomes a file.”

This mirrors elite ops thinking:

* Repetition → SOP
* SOP → delegation
* Delegation → leverage

Claude is trained exactly like a human admin—just faster and cheaper.

---

## 11. Why This Scales (and Most People Fail)

This works because:

* Files > chat history
* Roles > prompts
* Iteration > upfront design
* Claude is embedded **where work already happens**

It fails for people who:

* Treat LLMs as answer machines
* Avoid terminal + files
* Don’t externalize process
* Don’t think in delegation primitives

---

## 12. One-Sentence Summary

**Teresa uses Claude Code as a file-backed, role-scoped, continuously trained cognitive employee that recomputes her priorities daily, preserves thinking momentum, and compounds leverage through explicit memory and delegation.**

If you want, next steps could include:

* A **replicable “Personal OS” template**
* A **minimal starter version (2 folders, 1 CLAUDE.md)**
* A **mapping to your existing agent/MCP/A2A stack**

Say which direction to go.
